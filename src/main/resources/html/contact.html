<h1>Contacting Us</h1>

<p>We love to hear from our customers with feedback, testimonials,
	enquiries or product requests. We are less thrilled to receive bad news
	about lost or damaged parcels, prematurely broken products or
	complaints but we promise to respond to all messages in a prompt and
	courteous manner as all customers are important to us - even the
	unhappy ones.</p>

<p>
	The easiest is to send an email to <a
		href="mailto:contact@eyespynature.co.uk">contact@eyespynature.co.uk</a>
	for general requests or to <a href="mailto:support@eyespynature.co.uk">support@eyespynature.co.uk</a>
	for product support. We will endeavour to respond within 24 hours
	during a normal working week.
