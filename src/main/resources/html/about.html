<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>We are a small family business based in Abingdon which
	specialises in making high quality nestboxes out of ethically sourced
	materials. We offer a range of designs to suit different birds.</p>

<h2>Our commitment to be the environment</h2>

<p>All our hand made products are made from sustainably sourced
	Finnish spruce. Cosmetically damaged pieces are gathered together and
	made into products and sold at a discounted price. All leftover scraps
	that cannot be used are sent off to be recycled or composted.</p>

<p>
	All packaging and paperwork we use is made from 100% recycled materials
	and is 100% recyclable and 100% biodegradable. The only exception to
	this is the cardboard boxes which are only 70% recycled paper. It is
	however a single wall box that has been manufactured to be stronger
	than a double wall box thus reducing the amount a cardboard needed in
	its construction. We also use a <em>staple-less</em> stapler to bind
	our manuals together so that you do not have to remove staples to
	recycle the paper. All plastic bags are either reclaimed or the
	externally sourced product already came in it.

<h2>Our commitment to quality</h2>

<p>We use Finnish spruce plywood to make our products. Plywood is
	light, strong and stable and its use results in much less wasted wood
	than using solid boards. It also has the advantage that bugs do not
	like eating it. Our wooden parts are cut by CNC router for accuracy
	down to the millimeter and carefully finished and assembled by hand in
	small batches.</p>
